# Note #
# This build reduce the size of the final image by containing only what need to be executed (the jar file)
# But still it has one weakness that whenever pom.xml files change, the whole dependencies will be re-downloaded

# Run script #
# build docker image  : `docker build -f ex2.Dockerfile -t minh/docker-java:2.0 .`
# run docker container: `docker run --name docker-java -d -p 8080:8080 minh/docker-java:2.0`
# check localhost:8080/greeting
